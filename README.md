# NotificationSync
Forward your notifications from one Android device to another via FCM

You can use an old xiaomi or oppo or vivo or meizu device with google play service as a server, 
to forward the notifications pushed by mipush or oppo push or vivo push or meizu push to your main daily device like
samsung galaxy, google pixel, sony xperia etc.
For the reason that most of chinese android app do not support google fcm push, and the device besides xiaomi oppo vivo and
meizu can only use google fcm to receive background notifications(fuck gfw)
your main device don't need to be rooted, and the server also, only you need for the server is smooth international Internet.
and your main device can receive fcm push.

and also the samsung china has cooperated with Getui and Jiguang Push, to provide unified push service, but only few 
chinese apps use it to push ads, not even important information.
